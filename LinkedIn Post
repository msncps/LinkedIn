The requirement was when you select the month or hover your mouse over the table. You should see current and previous month's data on the tool-tip.

To achieve the outcome, I followed the following steps:-

1. Duplicate the "Sales" table and create a new one called "Sales_TT"

2. Measure 
	Last 2 Months = 
		VAR SelMonth = Month(Max(Sales[Date]))
		VAR Month = if(Month(Max(Sales_TT[Date]))>=Selmonth-1 && Month(Max(Sales_TT[Date]))<=Selmonth,SUM(Sales_TT[Sales]),blank())
Return 
	Month

3. Important Piece, you need to use date from your first table i.e. "Sales" for your 1st Variable SelMonth, the rest of all entities should be from your duplicate / referenced table i.e. Sales_TT.

4. For your visuals, use entities from Sales table. For Slicer, you entities from duplicate one "Sales_TT" table.

Follow these steps and let me know if you have got a better solution than this.

Many Thanks
